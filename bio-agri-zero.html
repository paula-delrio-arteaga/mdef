      <p class="paragraph">DIY Biology experiments: <br>‍<br>Two different kind of culture mediums were made in order to take samples and discover what types of bacterias were inhabiting. <br>DIY Auxitic Lactobacillus 2 - Medium. We used Agar, Tomato juice and Brovil sauce to create the medium. I divided the culture medium in two to see different outcomes of the experiment. In one side, I put some of my usual morning breakfast Yogurt, which was sheep milk yogurt with banana and some nuts. I believe the outcome of this sample would be fruitful due to the high amount of lactobacillus bacteria that usually inhabit in yogurt. <br>We would probably find some probiotics and other kind of fungi that are used to ferment milk in order to make yogurt. <br>While on the other side I put a sample of my saliva that I took from my tongue. We would probably find many kind of oral bacterias that inhabits in our mouth. I didn’t have any food or coffee before taking the sample, so it might be a bit more difficult to find lactobacillus bacteria in it. <br><br>DIY Yeast all purpose - Medium. <br>I put a sample of my hair, but it doesn&#x27;t have the follicle it is just half of a hair. I&#x27;m not sure we will find many bacterias for that reason, but if I think about it I&#x27;m always touching my hair and I came cycling to school so the particulars in the air could’ve been attached to it. So if we are lucky I will see some little guys growing there. <br><br><br></p>

      <h2 class="subtitle-2">How was the experience of finding points of resonance with others?</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">I had the chance to signed up in two groups: <br>- Post-consumer<br>- Solarpunk<br>It was really interesting how design spaces can evolve depending on the people that are conforming them. And I could also find some common interest between them. Even though I didn’t have too much time to get deeper on the conversation with them, I got to learn so much form all of them in this brief but intense knowledge sharing. <br>On the post-consumer group, we began putting our favourite cards related to the topic on the board and started creating connections and questions to find ways into developing new materials, what to do with our food waste, how to build a circular economy system... and sharing some projects of interest. <br>On the Solarpunk group, I had a bit more difficulties on how to approach the board and connections with my classmates. I felt that we had a lot to say about the topic and that we weren&#x27;t all able to go deeper on our perspectives since the topic is very wide and can be approached form many side. Nevertheless, I feel like fruitful project would definitely come out this group.<br></p>

        <p class="paragraph"><strong>Someone you would like to contact: </strong><br>I would like to contact the Coordinator of Metzineres: Talk to them to get a better understanding of what they do and see if they might be interested on doing a workshop with ceramics, biomaterial or gardening. Maybe gather a collaborative workshop with the ceramic atelier and the womxn from Metzineres.<br>I would also like to meet with Jessica Dias, she is biomaterial research and designer that is part of the Biobabes collective. A really good friend told me about her and how we would be really interested on each others work.<br>‍<br><strong>An experiment you’d like to make: <br></strong>Thanks to the multi-scalar diagram I highlighted an issue that we have at home. There are a lot of fruit flies in my kitchen due to separating organic waste. I want to develop a bioplastic that has citronella and apple cider vinegar to see if it would drive them away and also would makes more sense in order to create compost out of organic waste without having to use synthetic plastic bag. <strong><br></strong><br><strong>A new skill you’d like to add to your personal development plan<br></strong>I would like to develop Agricultural and Biomaterials skills in order to create new projects. <strong><br>‍</strong><br></p>
