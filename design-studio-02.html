        <h2 class="subtitle-2">Documentation beyond presentation</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">‍<strong>Reflection on how I&#x27;ve been documenting and communicating my work currently and how I will approach it moving forward in the master.</strong><br><br>I&#x27;ve always have problems on documenting my process in the past. I generally used to jump form an idea on my head to drawing it directly on a digital program. Or for instance when designing clothing I didn’t pay a lot of attention to the fact of taking pictures of the process. I&#x27;ve come to realise that it&#x27;s a very powerful tool that make our work more accessible and understandable to others. Moreover, documentation has been helping me understand better my own process as a designer. <br><br>I&#x27;ve also had a hard time facing the reflections moments. I&#x27;ve never liked to write much and always found difficulties expressing my self with words rather than visuals. I also think that the language barrier was pulling me backwards a lot. Nevertheless, I&#x27;ve found that I can identify and materialise ideas better when I try to explain them with words. Due to this new way of documenting I understood that writing would also help me on my personal growth, so I decided to start an introspective exercise, morning pages. Every morning before checking my phone I write 3 pages on a notebook. This is actually helping me a lot to break down my barriers with writing and to unlock my subconscious in order to get to know me better and how to perform as a 1PP designer. It is also a great tool to help yourself set goals.<br><br>I&#x27;ve been a bit chaotic with my documentation. I&#x27;ve been taking pictures and videos of processes; and also handwriting notes in different note books and digital notes on different devices and platforms. Actually thanks to the website I&#x27;ve been able to collect all these resources and make more sense out of it. I&#x27;ve been also using social media to keep up a more closer approach to reality, by means of exposing my self to the public and being open to receive feedback and create new connections. Writing on a notebook is more personal for me but at the same time requires more time. During the living with your own ideas experiment I started to record voice notes. I became aware that sitting on a bench to write notes, dragged me out of the moment and by sending myself audio messages I was able to stay more present of my surroundings and my thoughts about it.<br> <br>I want to approach my documentation from a more personal and emotional approach. I will probably keep using the same tools but I will focus more on voice memos, handwriting and maybe try to get back to sketching. I was also think on doing a fast clay sculpture everyday or every-two days because I really enjoy working with clay and I miss it. I feel like is a very gratifying process for me. And I could discover new ideas by doing it as a challenge. In general tangible things are more attractive to me, but I&#x27;m always scared to make them. So with this challenge I will maybe persuade those fears. I have also started to hack my mobile&#x27;s cam with a polygonal crystal to recreate a bee&#x27;s eye, in order to have a more collaborative perspective with others, bees and insects in this case. Editing is also a big important part to communicate the process and reach our audiences better. It&#x27;s important to be selective with what we show and how we show it. I will like to also use my skills on video editing and motion graphics to create videos, even though it can take a lot of time. So I might need to find a balance between the final communication video and the raw content. <br><br>‍<br>‍<br>‍<br></p>
