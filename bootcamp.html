          <p class="paragraph">“ So first I started to think about all the causes and fights that are important to me, like fight against patriarchy, racism and LGBTQI+phobia. Or how to end up with big corporations that keeps feeding the plastic crisis and generating crazies amounts of CO2 regardless the, more than proven, climate emergency the planet is suffering.<br>‍<br>For me you can’t change one aspect without considering the rest of factors that affect directly or indirectly to the problem.<br>That’s way I believe in intersectional environmentalism, which aim is to dismantle systems of oppression in the environmental movement. Acknowledging the ways in which injustices affect marginalised communities and mother earth are interconnected.<br>It’s an inclusive form of environmentalism that advocates for the protection of all people + the planet.<br>‍<br>So yes, I could tell you that that’s my fight, but honestly I feel a little bit like a fraud. <br>I have come to realise that to make the world a better place, I have to be better first.<br><br>My main actual fight is against myself. How to detach myself from all the prejudices, certain behaviours, thoughts… that are within my inner self polluted by society, education and an economical system that I’ve grown in. And how I want to change, improve and take real action. Because for me one of the most important thing about fighting a cause is how to reach others and make them join you. I think that to share a consistent message I have to be a real example. So I wanted to represent myself without being me. Detached from all the prejudices, thoughts and being more conscious of my actions to grow as a new human.<br><br>The superego overlapping the ego.<br><br>That’s is my real main fight.<br>Because once I reach that better version of myself I would be able to defend all the causes I believe on straight forward. “<br><br></p>

        <p class="paragraph-2">¨I realised that I wanted my career to the have a positive impact on the future that we are shaping. Henceforth, I will always strive toward the personal aim of designing for projects that matter. I want to expand my knowledge in the area of sustainability and technology in an effort to combine it with my artistic background. (...)<br>My vision is to be able to materialise and execute ideas from the conceptual level to their tangible implementation. Through this study, I would like to gain the tools and frameworks to accomplish that implementation. Additionally, I would like to connect with like-minded individuals, building strong networks that can potentially result in the fruition of impactful creative technical solutions. Nevertheless, I belive in an intersectional future, an inclusive form of environmentalism that <br>advocates for the protection of all people + the planet.¨</p>

          <div>
            <p class="paragraph">This first week of the Masters was at the same time interesting and a challenging one for me. We got a closer look of what is to be a designer for emergent futures. <br>‍<br>I found myself in a discomfort position many times during this week. Even though I&#x27;m an outgoing person and I had the chance to talked to many of my classmates during the pre-course weeks. When it comes to talk about myself and my deepest believes and fears in public, I get really nervous and insecure.<br>So having to present my fight in front of my classmates was an actual challenge for me. Nevertheless I got a really good feedback from some of them which made me feel like I got a positive outcome of this experience. I also really enjoyed to know more about their fights and the ways the have to express themselves. Made me realise that we have many common interests, yet many different perspectives which is gonna be a great breeding ground for the projects we are going to develop.<br><br>The methodology of the first person perspective really resonated on me, I was really carvings for a new way of acting as a designer within the world, a community and myself. To start to design from a 1st pp we needed to do an introspective exercise, that again made me feel quite uncomfortable. Having to spot our skills, attitudes and knowledge in order to create a hybrid profile in the future. To be honest, it reminded me a lot of therapy and how I been trying to define who I&#x27;m since for me my personal profile and my professional one have to be always merging. I was scared of doing this exercise because I thought that my skills aren&#x27;t that good or that I would find common interests among my classmates. </p>

          <div>
            <p class="paragraph">Once again I was completely wrong, I had the chance to talk to some of them about their skills, attitudes and knowledge and I came to realise that we can truly enrich each other and it also helped me to define my hybrid profile. I know now that my apparently lack of knowledge and my uncertainty has put me on the position of having 30 extra teachers and I can&#x27;t wait to learn more from all of them.<br>‍<br>And in like many other moments of my life, facing an out of the comfort zone situation has lead me to fruitful results. I got the feeling that I will sense this many more times during this 9 months, what makes me feel excited to see the results that we are yet to achieve.<br></p>

            <p class="paragraph">Last but not least, during week we had the chance to visit Elisava and Poblenou. There were so many interesting projects exhibited at Elisava, that for sure gave us some hopes and inspiration. I was really surprised but the amount of interesting places Poblenou holds. Personally I was specifically attracted by the ConnectHort place, since one of my area of interest resides on reconnecting with nature and how cities and rural could be merged together to build a more sustainable future. <br>‍</p>
