      <p class="paragraph">The second part of the seminar extendence intelligence was carried out by Ramón Sangüeza and Lucas Lorenzo Peña. We dived into ethics, boundaries and frameworks to better understand what intelligence actually means in an artificial world. There were so many interesting references of projects created with AI and how those have evolved during time. I will definitely have to go  deeper into all the articles and books that they have shared with us. I find that AI is a very complex world but nowadays many of us can have access to it and there are many tutorials and open source platforms to experiment with the different neural networks and its implications. <br></p>
      <h1 class="subtitle-blog">Theoretically AI tool:</h1>
      <p class="paragraph">In order to have a more critical approach to AI and Animistic design we were asked to develop a theoretical project of an AI object that will help us as a tool in our daily lives. My group was composed of Marina, Tatiana, Julia, Pippa and Anna. We started dreaming big and having some blackmirror based ideas of a tool that will help us capture the ideas of our brains when we are about to sleep. These almost considered dreams are usually hard to remember the next day and for many of us are usually good ideas that we would love to carry out. <br><br>Following the idea of dreams and sleep and how much it affects us, we started to talk more about how important a good rest is. Most of us have experienced sleep paralysis in our nights and we realized that it’s a commonly unknown problem that many people suffer and don&#x27;t know how to wake up from it. We theoretically developed an AI object that will peacefully wake up  the subject once she/he is having a sleep paralysis episode. Please find the presentation below.<br></p>
