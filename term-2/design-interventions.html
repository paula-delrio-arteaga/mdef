      <p class="paragraph">In the topic of inclusivity activism and Intercomunities collaborations, I have started to build a relationship with the Organization Metziners. Their objective is to help womxn and non-binary people that are drug users and suffer situations of vulneravility and violence. By covering their basic necessities and giving them a safe space where they can feel understood and supported. Founding pillars of self-confidence and independence on a peer to peer methodology, where the womxn express their necessities and even create workshops between them. <br><br>After our first conversation they told me that womxn are always recycling clothes and that my background in fashion would be interesting to organize a workshop, since they had a great time when doing something similar in the past. They usually perform a lot of creative activities and  have access to the internet  and a small library. They have some lockers for them to keep valuable things since many of them are living on the streets. The owner mentioned that they have a lot  of problems with the lockers because they break easily. <br><br>Every Friday they organize a Paella all together. I will be going this Friday to get to know the womxn better and build trust with them to see if they would like to do any of the activities mentioned below.<br><br>1st ideas of possibilities of intervention: <br>● Try to understand and fix the problem with the lockers?<br>● Contact the ceramic atelier next to them and organize a ceramic workshop around traditional ancient ceramic cooking tools to reinvent them and make them more accessible, from the womxn perspective. <br>● Help them with technologies and computational skills?<br>● Create a swapping clothes market in el raval, with the help of other organizations like Humana.<br>● Recycling-stylism clothing workshop and photoshooting.Collect food waste from the green pavilion to organize a Paella Madura.<br>● Organize a transversal workshop with Can batlló, about urban agriculture, doing a calçotada, using the library… <br><br>It will depend on the womxn interests.<br></p>
      <h1 class="subtitle-blog">Paella Friday by Metzineres</h1>
      <p class="paragraph"><strong>28 - 01 -2022<br>‍</strong><br>Every Friday they organize a Paella lunch in the Agora el Raval, a communitarian space that after a lot of work they are nowaday finally welcome. I got to know a bit more of the participants and they were really welcoming and warm. <br>‍<br>At First I was a bit shy and scared of giving the wrong impression of an outsider, I wondered if the clothes I was wearing would be appropriate for the occasion since I didn’t want to give too much the look of the privileged woman I am. Was funny to talk to Clara, a transwoman who is a makeup artist and was analysing my outfit as I said I’m a designer. I got really along with her and I hope I can see her more often because she told me that it&#x27;s not usually going there anymore. I asked if she was imparting make-up workshops to the rest: to which she replied they won&#x27;t pay me enough for what I’m worth. I tried to participate in paella making but since I’m not an expert and didn’t want to ruin it I was just following orders.<br><br>Aida told me about another okupa place where they organize a flamenco show on sunday, I didn&#x27;t think I would have time to go but I was really happy she invited me. Their main problem is usually housing. They don’t have a place to stay and many of them are sleeping on the streets. The conversation tackled the topic of rape and sexual abuse many times. They don&#x27;t have a safe space to go and usually are not welcome because of their gender expression. Even though they are suffering a difficult life, they have great humor and they were dancing and singing. Was a good sunny day, a man was playing the piano and many of us mentioned how good he was and how we recognized some of the songs. I didn’t have the chance to talk about my ideas of ceramics workshops with them but I felt it wasn’t the moment. Ursula is a project technician that started as a participant and now she works for Metziners. She is a great example for the rest and manages the situation very well. <br>‍<br>Talking with Ari also opened my eyes and I have realized that any kind of possible intervention is gonna take some time. They are very open to ideas and want to have an outside impact when a workshop or performance is done. It’s very important to give them visibility and help remove the stigma around these communities. Aura, the owner of the place, wants to build strong relationships with designers and see how we can design new systems of collaboration that will sustain in time. Consistency and commitment to causes are key aspects to have into account.<br><br>What if we could create a better system for them to communicate about safe spaces to sleep?<br>Sense of belonging is also very important, they were really proud talking about them as a family. <br>Design with them and not for them. <br>They want to go a step further than mere assistance and help with visibility and activism in this sense.<br><br>I want to ask them more questions about their housing situations, work, jobs, and love life are key aspects. It’s so fucked up, that some want to take hormones but they will lose sexual appetite. <br>At agora there is also a space to work on the huerto urbano they have and they will be there tomorrow from 15:50. <br>‍<br>Why is this important for me? Can this be part of my project or would it just be volunteer work? <br><br></p>

      <p class="paragraph"><strong>04 - 02 - 2022</strong><br><br>I have decided to continue going every Friday if it&#x27;s possible to the Paella. Today was a grey day in Barcelona and you could sense it in everyones mood. I didn&#x27;t manage to arrive at lunch time since I have a personal meeting, so this time I decided to no arrive with empty hands and bring some chocolate for the gxrls as dessert. <br>‍</p>
