      <h1 class="subtitle-blog">Nation-State</h1>
      <p class="paragraph">During the last class, we talked about the nation of state. Each of us had to reply to the questions: Where were you born? Where were your parents born? How many passports do you have? Where would you say you are from? What are the problems of the society you were raised in?  In this multicultural class where many of us are not from Barcelona, was really interesting to know all the origins of each of us. And it was helpful to understand how is the global context that we are moving in right now. I personally want to reflect on how my sense of belonging has changed a lot since I’m living in Barcelona. As I explained in class I was born in Sevilla and sometimes I have found myself sounding super-patriotic about Spain (which I’m certainly not) just because some Catalan people would like to make the distinction between our cultures to which I don’t fully agree. Every region of Spain is very different culturally talking but that it’s what makes this country richer and interesting from my point of view. Sometimes I feel like people spend way too much time looking at what makes us different instead of appreciating all the things we have in common. So when I’ve been asked where I’m from in Barcelona I would say Sevilla, sometimes wondering if my answer would get any weird faces or responses. I do feel like an immigrant in my own country while when I was living in Madrid I didn’t have that feeling. I also want to highlight that The Ukrainian Bellic conflict has changed my mind a lot when identifying myself as a European, because Europe has been disappointing me a lot… And I feel like being European is such a privilege that I acknowledge but at the same time makes me super frustrated. As I mentioned before colonialism is still very rooted and Europe still acts with superiority towards other countries, which I don’t like at all. Borders exist that’s a reality, but… I don’t know, I don’t like the way is managed. And I wish all kinds of refugees were treated as they should be, Refugees! No matter the country you’re coming from or the way you look. </p>
